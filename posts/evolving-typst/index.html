        <h1>Evolving Typst</h1>
        <time datetime="2026-01-05T00:00:00.000Z">January 5, 2026</time>
        <p>
          People frequently ask when we will release a 1.0 version of Typst. The
          version number “0” is often taken as an indicator of immaturity, as a
          big sign that says “this software isn’t yet ready for use.”
          Personally, I think that’s quite unfortunate. I <em>do</em> consider
          Typst ready for production use and yet I think releasing a 1.x version
          now would be naive.
        </p>
        <p>
          To me, the version number is not a marketing tool but a promise on a
          technical level. Typst uses <em>semantic versioning</em> and
          <a href="https://semver.org">SemVer</a> connects certain guarantees to
          the different parts of a version number. Thus, we need to be sure what
          those guarantees are and whether we can give them before publishing a
          release.
        </p>
        <p>
          For a project on version number 1.x, SemVer requires the project to
          release a 2.x when it introduces a breaking change. What constitutes a
          breaking change though is up to the project / ecosystem the project
          lives in.
        </p>
        <p>
          For Typst, it’s actually pretty hard to come up with a good
          definition! Sometimes, it’s clear cut: For example, a clearly
          incompatible change to the syntax is of course breaking. But what
          about a change that results in a slightly different layout? A change
          to the default value of a styling property? A change to a built-in
          show rule that lets user styles compose differently? A change to the
          internal sorting behavior that happens to
          <a href="https://github.com/typst/typst/pull/7528"
            >break existing incorrect code</a
          >? It’s just not that simple and I think figuring out how to classify
          these different kinds of changes is crucial before we make some kind
          of promise about how we handle breaking changes.
        </p>
        <p>
          That’s just one part though. The other part about reaching 1.x is that
          there are a few changes I want to make to Typst that are breaking no
          matter how you look at them. These changes have been on the horizon
          for a while (people have been eagerly waiting for custom elements
          since basically the open-source release). Part of why they haven’t
          happened yet is simply that they are technically and design-wise
          complex and that we’ve prioritized other things.
        </p>
        <p>
          But there’s a second hindrance that has been growing stronger.
          Regardless of the lack of a promise, Typst <em>has</em> de facto
          increasingly become more stable. When I look back at the recent Typst
          releases, breaking changes have become tamer and more minor.
          Especially with the growth of Typst Universe, breaking something
          foundational would have rippling effects through the ecosystem.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let’s say you want to upgrade your project to make use of some new
          compiler feature. If one of the packages you use is broken on that
          version and there isn’t yet an updated version, you can’t really do
          much. That sucks. Now, assume you’re good on your dependencies but the
          new version has a pesky syntax change, forcing you to adapt large
          parts of your markup. That sucks less, but it’s still annoying.
        </p>
        <p>
          On a SemVer level, we can just throw our hands up and say “that’s the
          cost of doing business, we’re on 0.x after all.” And I think that’s
          entirely fair. Yet, in practice, there’s more to it: If breaking
          changes are painful for the ecosystem, as a maintainer, it also
          becomes increasingly painful to make them. You start thinking “can I
          avoid this change?”, “can I batch these three changes?”, etc. There is
          some good in this, as it forces you to be deliberate in your actions,
          but it also slows down the project and reduces the chance that very
          breaking changes that would be for the better still happen.
        </p>
        <p>
          I’m not content with this situation. As I said, I do consider Typst
          production-ready, but at the same time also
          <em>far from done.</em> There are still lots of things I want to ship
          and some of those require changing Typst in incompatible ways. That’s
          why I think that, even at a 0.x stage, it’s well worth asking
          ourselves the question: What can we do to make breakage less painful?
          Doing this somewhat egoistically to allow us to act more freely and
          fearlessly.
        </p>
        <hr />
        <p>
          So what <em>can</em> we do? Let’s take a look at the first, more
          painful of the two scenarios I’ve painted above. You
          <em>really</em> need that new layout feature, but your diagramming
          package just isn’t updated yet and you also happen to really need your
          diagrams. Let’s say you’re upgrading from 0.14 to 0.15 and there’s
          some breaking syntax change. Solving this problem isn’t actually that
          hard. There is a clear boundary between your project and the diagram
          package and it’s entirely possible for Typst to expose different
          behavior to both. Typst only needs a very small amount of information
          to do this: Which behavior to expose to what.
        </p>
        <p>
          The behavior you want Typst to expose to a package is the one that it
          exposed at the time the package was developed. In essence, this means
          you’re developing against a <em>target</em> Typst version. This is a
          parallel concept to the <em>minimum</em> Typst version that you can
          already declare in <code>typst.toml</code> through the
          <code>compiler</code> field. Consequently, I could imagine the
          following syntax:
        </p>
        <pre><code class="language-toml"><span class="hljs-section">[package]</span>
<span class="hljs-attr">name</span> = <span class="hljs-string">&quot;fancy-diagrams&quot;</span>
<span class="hljs-attr">version</span> = <span class="hljs-string">&quot;0.4.0&quot;</span>
<span class="hljs-attr">entrypoint</span> = <span class="hljs-string">&quot;lib.typ&quot;</span>
<span class="hljs-attr">compiler</span> = { min = <span class="hljs-string">&quot;0.15&quot;</span>, target = <span class="hljs-string">&quot;0.17&quot;</span> }
</code></pre>
        <p>
          With this, your package would say, “I don’t work on anything below
          0.15 and if you’re newer than 0.17, please avoid exposing breaking
          changes since 0.17 to me.” And
          <code>compiler = &quot;0.15&quot;</code> would be short for both being
          equal.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you’re familiar with Rust, this will probably remind you of the
          <em>Edition</em> mechanism and technically it’s indeed basically that.
          Socially though, I would think of it in a different way. I would not
          commit to retaining a particular compatibility behavior forever, as
          over time that could complicate the compiler codebase a lot. Rather, I
          would keep it for a version or two, to smooth out the effects of a
          change on the ecosystem, giving people and packages time to adapt and
          migrate. To me, a nice way to think about it is as a
          <em>deprecation warning on steroids.</em> Indeed, I would probably
          even warn every time such behavior was triggered.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note also that the <code>target</code> setting would not be a promise
          of stability: If it’s very easy to have compatibility behavior for a
          breaking change, we’d naturally include it, but if a change had only
          minor impact and it would be overly hard or even impossible to have
          compatibility behavior, we could still make a normal breaking change.
          Just like we do with deprecation warnings now.
        </p>
        <p>
          There remains the question what to do with packages that don’t specify
          a target. To get the most out of this mechanism with the current
          package ecosystem, the reasonable course of action would be to apply
          all available compatibility behavior. However, it could be confusing
          if you create a new package and suddenly Typst returns to ancient
          behavior. For this reason, I would make the
          <code>compiler</code> field required, but express this requirement by
          warning rather than error, at least for now.<sup class="footnote-ref"
            ><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          As for a Typst project itself (not a package), always exposing the
          latest behavior seems very reasonable to me as you have full access to
          the sources to apply necessary migrations. Besides, you could also
          just stay on an older compiler version if you really needed to. That
          said, for rare use cases, I could still imagine a CLI flag/setting
          that selects the target version for a project.
        </p>
        <hr />
        <p>
          This <code>target</code> mechanism would let us make breaking changes
          without immediately disrupting the entire ecosystem. It buys time for
          people to migrate. What it doesn’t do is speed up the migration
          itself. How to deal with a particular breaking change of course
          depends on the nature of the change. A change could be trivial to fix
          syntactically or it could require intricate semantic changes.
        </p>
        <p>
          I think for some of these changes it would be worthwhile to provide
          automated migration tooling. This is something we’re in particular
          considering for likely upcoming changes to math precedence (see my
          <a href="/posts/math-mode-problem">“Math Mode Problem”</a> blog post
          for background on that).
        </p>
        <p>
          Another potential such change that stands in the room (but isn’t yet
          decided on) would rejig the function parameter syntax.The current
          <code>param: default</code> would become
          <code>param: type = default</code>, with the <code>: type</code> part
          being an <em>optional</em> type annotation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Both of these examples are syntactical and would affect lots of
          documents. This makes them ideal candidates for automated migration
          tooling. More semantic migrations could also be feasible, but the cost
          vs impact trade-off would need to be judged on a case-by-case basis. I
          certainly wouldn’t promise to ship migration tooling for every
          breaking change.
        </p>
        <p>
          There isn’t yet a concrete design for migration tooling, so consider
          this post a kick-off for design discussions. For me personally, the
          priorities would be discoverability, ease of use, avoidance of false
          positives, and good integration into both the CLI and the web app.
        </p>
        <p>
          On an implementation level, the target compatibility mechanism and
          migration tooling could actually be closely related! For instance, it
          could make sense to first compile a document in compatible mode,
          collecting all sites where compatibility behaviors have been triggered
          and then directly using this information to drive the automated
          migration.
        </p>
        <hr />
        <p>
          Even though Typst is still on version number zero, as it has matured,
          the project has grown some resistance against change. This is a
          <em>healthy</em> thing for a project to develop as it ensures change
          is well-motivated. On the flip side, it also encumbers large changes
          for the better.
        </p>
        <p>
          Technically, the version number zero allows us to freely make breaking
          changes. However, this ignores the social capital expended by
          repeatedly disrupting what people build on Typst. Some might argue
          that putting work into migration tooling at a 0.x stage is work spent
          on the wrong priorities. I would beg to differ. I consider it a good
          investment <em>now</em> as it lets us break Typst more freely while
          <em>also</em> bringing it closer to stability and the version number
          “1.0” people so much desire!

                The fact that it’s a warning instead of an error would in itself
                form a compatibility behavior. If you didn’t specify the
                compiler field, you also didn’t specify a target version that
                matches or exceeds the version where the target version
                mechanism itself was introduced.
